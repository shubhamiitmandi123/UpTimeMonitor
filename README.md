# Uptime Monitoring Service.
- Monitors URLs or websites by doing an HTTP GET request
- The system accepts a list of URL, Crawl Timeout(In seconds), Frequency(In Seconds), Failure Threshold
- The system iterates over all the URLs in the system and try to do an HTTP GET on the URL, and wait for the crawl_timeout seconds if the response is not 200 OK, it marks as a failure and increases the failure count in the database
- Once the failure count reaches to failure threshold it marks the URL as inactive and stops crawling

## Tech Stack Used:
- Golang - gin (microframework)
- Mysql
  - Gorm as orm library
- Docker


## API
### Base URL
```
http://localhost:8080
```


### To Register A New URL For Monitoring 
Use `POST /urls/` to add a URL to the service and provide the following data as a JSON string.
- crawl_timeout: Time for which system wait before giving up on URL.
- frequency:  It determines how frequently a URL will be pinged.
- failure_threshold: As failure count reaches the threshold, the System mark is inactive and stops crawling it.
#### Provided information is stored into database and an UUID is Assigned with each URL 
- Request: `POST /urls`
```
{
   "url":                        ”www.example.com”,
   "crawl_timeout":              10,
   “frequency”:                  15, 
   “failure_threshold” :         10,  
}
```
Response:
```
{
  "id":"                        b7f32a21-b863-4dd1-bd86-e99e8961ffc6",
  "url":                        ”www.example.com”,
  "crawl_timeout":              10,
  “frequency”:                  15,
  “failure_threshold” :         10,
  “status”:                     “active”,
  “failure_count”:               0
}

```

- Curl Command Example:
```
curl -i -X POST http://localhost:8080/urls --header "Content-Type: application/json" --data '{"url": "https://www.google.com", "frequency": 10,"crawl_timeout" : 8, "failure_threshold":3 }'
```


### To GET A Already Stored Url Information 
Use `GET /urls/:id` to fetch monitoring information of a URL that has the corresponding id.


- Request: `GET /urls/:id`
- Response:
```
{
  "id":"                        b7f32a21-b863-4dd1-bd86-e99e8961ffc6",
  "url":                        ”www.example.com”,
  "crawl_timeout":              10,
  “frequency”:                  15,
  “failure_threshold” :         10,
  “status”:                     “active”,
  “failure_count”:               0,
}

```

- Curl Command Example:
```
curl -i -X GET http://localhost:8080/urls/b7f32a21-b863-4dd1-bd86-e99e8961ffc6
```




### To Update URL Information 
Use `PATCH /urls/:id` and Provide the following data as a JSON string.
- crawl_timeout 
- frequency
- failure_threshold
#### Note :
- Provide any/all above parameters, only provided parameters will be updated rest will remain the same
- Only the above parameters can be updated     
- Request: `POST /urls/:id`
```
{
   "crawl_timeout":              10,
   “frequency”:                  15, 
   “failure_threshold” :         10,  
}
```
Response:
```

  ```git clone https://github.com/shubhamiitmandi123/UpTimeMonitor.git```
4. cd UpTimeMonitor
5. If you have golang installed in your machine and want to run on your local machine then
-  Edit .env file and write your MySQL host, password, port, and database name you created.

export DB_USER="your_mysql_user_name"
export DB_PASS="your_mysql_password"
export DB_NAME="database_name"
export DB_HOST="mysql_host_IP_Address"
export DB_PORT="Port_of_mysql_server"
```
- Note: if your MySQL server is installed on the host machine then change the host to host.docker.internal
```
export DB_HOST="host.docker.internal"
```

``` 
go mod download
```

```
docker build -t schoudhary2608/uptimemonitor.
```
- Run container
```
docker run -p 8080:8080 -e DOCKER=true -e DB_USER='user' -e DB_PASS='password' -e DB_HOST='host' -e DB_PORT='3306' -e DB_NAME='database_name' schoudhary2608/uptimemonitor

```
- Note: if your MySQL server is installed on the host machine then provide host "host.docker.internal"

- Docker image is also available on the docker hub
